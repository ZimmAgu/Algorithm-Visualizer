# Algorithms
You start by choosing an algorithm

The following algorithms are available for visualization
Dijkstra
Depth First Search
Breadth First Search



# Current Speed
The current speed dropdown menu on the navbar controls the speed at which the algorithms get visualizes

The following speeds are available to choose from:
Slow
Normal
Fast


# Visualize Button
Once you have chosen your desired algorithm, press the visualize button in the middle of the navigation bar and the visualization for the algorithm will atart


# Controls
Click and hold the start node or th end node to relocate it to another nod

Click an unvisited node to turn it into a wall. You can also drag your mouse along unvisited nodes to make several walls at once
